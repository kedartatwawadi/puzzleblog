title: Number of Pentagons in a Football
---

I encountered this fascinating puzzle during the class of Graph Theory by Prof. Abhiram Ranade a few months ago when I was still a student.
I was especially awestruck by the beauty of the puzzle!

##Introduction
Everyone has seen a football, and many of you have played with it.
For the uninformed, the football looks something like this:

As you can see, it is composed of 'hexagonal' and 'pentagonal' patches.
It almost always goes unnoticed , but this **Football** always has *exactly* **12** pentagonal faces. Dont believe yet?! Have a look at the images below:

So the 'bucky-ball', fullerenes, the rugby,football etc. any ball composed of pentagonal and hexagonal patches, will have exactly 12 pentagonal patches.
For Clarity, we define the problem mathematicall below:

##The Problem

Consider any planar graph ( or any polyhedron, as a polyhedron can be converted to a planar graph by stereographic projection! ), such that:
- It is formed by hexagonal and pentagonal faces only
- Each edge shares exactly 2 faces, and each vertex has degree 3

For such a graph, proove that the numbe rof pentagonal faces is exactly equal to 12!
