title: The Domino Effect

There are some really special problems featuring dominoes.
But a few of them really stand out for the ingenuinity and simplicity of the solution.

Lets take a look at two of these problems:
Beware! these are seemingly similar, though entirely different problems.

### Problem 1

Consider a 8x8 chessboard ( standard 64 square ).
Lets say that the number of ways to cover this chessboard with 2x1 dominoes, such that every square is covered only once, is *N*.
Well, this does seem to be a pretty hard problem.

Now, lets make it harder :P ! Lets say, two diagonally opposite squares of the chessboard are removed. In such a scenario, what is the number of ways to cover this board in terms of *N* ?

Hint: Some information in the problem is for misleading the way :P

### Problem 2

We consider yet another puzzle concerning boards and 2×1 dominoes. Given a 2×15 board, find the number of ways of completely covering it up using 2×1 dominoes ( without overflow or underflow of squares).

Comments: Thanks Adwaitvedant for the awesome solution to the problem. For those who want some hints, this is it. ( smell some *recursion* ?).
