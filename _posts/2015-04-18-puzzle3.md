title: In the *dual* world of nim games 
---

Thanks to Apoorv for the awesome puzzle.

100 coins of different denominations are placed on a line.
The game involves the *two* players taking chances to pick up any one of the coins at the two endpoints of the line.

The player with the higher total money at the end of the game with it! Is there a winning strategy for the player who makes the first move?
Note that the coins can be of any arbitrary denominations!
