title: The poisoned wine
---

You have 240 barrels of wine, one of which has been poisoned.  After drinking the poisoned wine, one dies within 24 hours.  You have 5 slaves whom you are willing to sacrifice in order to determine which barrel contains the poisoned wine.  How do you achieve this in 48 hours?

## Discussion

This problem gives insights into the world of Group Testing , Error Correcting codes, etc. The problem itself is a typical group testing problem with a slight twist that one can ‘reuse’ the servants who are alive. If you are stuck, try the subproblem first. The given problem is an extension.

1) Assume similar problem setup , where you have only 30 barrels amongst which 1 is poisoned. You need to figure out the poisoned barrel in 24 hours with the help of 5 willing servants
