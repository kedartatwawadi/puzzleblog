The puzzle is a variant of a standard problem, and appeared in the midsem exam of the Probability and random processes course at IIT Bombay 
[Prof. Sibi Raj Pillai](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/bsraj) )

Say  we have 100 students and 100 pairs of shoes. The first person coming out forget which shoe he had worn, and arbitrarily choses some pair and leaves. The other students wear their own shoes if possible, else they wear some random pair of shoes . 

In such a scenario:
###Problem1 What is the probability that the 100th person gets his own shoe

###What is probability that the 100th person gets his own shoe given that the students numbered 2,5,10,12 get their own shoes, while the 8th student doesnâ€™t get his own shoe.
