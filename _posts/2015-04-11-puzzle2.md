title: Mathematical Gems 
---

Ross honsberger although being a mathematician of great calibre, was famous more for his beautiful books rather than his mathematical research. ONe such series of books, **The Mathematical Gems** contains a treasure of beautiful and elegant problems, which always surprise me with the ingenuinity of the solutions even after so many years.

This is an attempt to keep a collection of such treasures from various sources. I will try my best to classify them according to the mathematical technique used. 

### Everybody knows Mr. Ramsey

At a dinner party in a upstate locale in London, Mr Ramsey mentioned a titbit to the educated audience:

*If you pick up any 6 people from the world, 
at least 3 of them know each other, or 3 of them dont know each other*

Although, it might be true that Mr. Ramsey might have gulped a couple of glasses when he stated the fact,
it is indeed true! Can you try to understand why?
