title: Mathematical Gems 
---

Ross honsberger although being a mathematician of great calibre, was famous more for his beautiful books rather than his mathematical research. ONe such series of books, **The Mathematical Gems** contains a treasure of beautiful and elegant problems, which always surprise me with the ingenuinity of the solutions even after so many years.

This is an attempt to keep a collection of such treasures from various sources. I will try my best to classify them according to the mathematical technique used.
